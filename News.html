                <h1>Dublin's rental market?<br>Words fail me</h1>
                <p>Dear Editor,<br><br>After months of searching, viewing, applying, begging, grovelling, and
                once seriously considering renting a converted wardrobe in Drumcondra described as a "cosy micro-studio with rustic
                beams(exposed pipes)," I've come to the conclusion that Dublin's rental market is not so much broken as it it actively trolling us.
            <br>Last week, I viewed a flat where the estate agent proudly declared it had "period features". These included mould, a carpet older than the GPO, and a mysterious cupboard that hummed.
            When I asked if it had heating, he replied, "Well, the upstairs neighbour smokes a lot, so that helps."<br>
            Rent? €1,850 a month, not including utilities, dignity, or sense of hope. There was another place described as "perfect for a 
            couple or a single person who does't mnd climbing." it was a converted attic with a bed only accessible via something that looked like a ladder from a pirate ship.
            The shower was in the kitchen, and the oven was in the hallway. I'm not even making that up. I wish I was.
            <br>And I'm now convinced landlords are writing listings using AI trained on Victorian novels and delusion. "Charming urban nook."
            "Characterful quarters.""Open-plan living experience(no doors)."
        <br>So I've decided to remain in my current rental situation, which is technically my mother's house, where the rent is free and the rules include calling
    her to say goodnight if I'm out past eleven.<br><br>
    <br>Yours sincerely,
    <br>Aisling Bourke,
    <br>Blackrock</p>
